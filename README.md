Monitoring IP Addresses
=========================

This project is a simple tool to monitor the reachability of IP addresses.

It will send a ping request to each IP address and report whether the IP address
is reachable or not.

The tool is written in Python and uses the `os` and `subprocess` modules to
execute the ping command.

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aviram598/monitoring-ip-addresses).
